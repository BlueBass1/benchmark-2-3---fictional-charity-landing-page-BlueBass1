          We here at Technos are have witnessed strides for the future of
          Cybernetics not only in our own research centers, but also in the
          inspiring progress made by other scientists! With what we've seen, we
          felt motivated to aid fellow researchers in their financial
          endeavours. We have spent over a $2.5 million throughout 5 years for
          funding promising projects.

          As a company, we have been focused on making advancements in the field
          Cybernetics. Our passion led us to realize that we could help create
          progress beyond our own organization. We knew that we could shift some
          of our funds to other groups who had potential, but lacked the funds
          to sustain their projects. After we took action and started to fund
          what we could to other researchers, we began to acknowledge that we
          could do even more. So we started the CE charity.

          Our goal is to raise even more funding so that we can encourage new
          life to join the field despite financial obstacles. We also plan to
          bridge the gap between the researchers and the common people. We have
          a newsletter that brings updates to those who want to learn more about
          what goes on in the world of cybernetics. It includes personal stories
          from interviews we have hosted, and it will display the work that is
          going towards a better tomorrow.
